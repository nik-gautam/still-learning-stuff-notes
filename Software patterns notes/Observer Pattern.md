# Observer Pattern
> **The Observer Pattern** defines one-to-many dependecy between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updates automatically.

Like a newspaper subscription servicew with its publisher and subscribers.

The Observer patterns provides an object design where subjects and observers are lossely coupled.
Because, the only thing that the subject needs to know about the observers is that it implements the observer interface.
